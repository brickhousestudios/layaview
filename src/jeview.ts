A local visualizer for Laya decisions at ${origin}, with a live view of every call at ${origin}/
Layaview is a gateway, not a model: it sits between a System One-shaped client and a local Laya adapter. Each request
goes to that adapter, Laya's answer goes back to the caller, and the call is kept whole (what was asked, what Laya
answered) in a SQLite database on this machine. By default both Layaview and the Laya adapter stay on loopback.

## Send Laya decision requests here

Send ${origin}/v1/systemone a JSON body { model, state, questions }. To group requests under a project or label, add it
to the path: ${origin}/<label>/v1/systemone.

## Link a question to the answer that led to it

Every answer comes back with an event id in "events": { "<question id>": "<call>:<question id>" }.
When a later request follows from one of those answers, send its event id in a header:
Layaview-Trigger: <event id>.
The viewer grows that request's questions as a branch off the answer that triggered them. Layaview strips both
Layaview-* headers and legacy Jeview-* aliases before calling Laya, and sends the body on exactly as it came.

## Show an option by its name, not its key

The viewer labels each answer with the option's key, such as "c14". When the criteria behind the keys are objects, use
Layaview-Display: name, or a field per question: Layaview-Display: category=name, kind=title. A field may be a path,
such as meta.title. Legacy Jeview-Display remains accepted as a compatibility alias.

## When a call is refused

Whatever the Laya adapter answers, a refusal included, comes back to the caller. Layaview's own refusals are JSON,
{ "error": "..." }:

- 400: a Layaview-Trigger that is empty or longer than 200 characters.
- 413: a body over ${BODY_LIMIT / 1024 / 1024} MB.
- 502: Laya could not be reached, or its answer was cut short.
- 403: the request came from a web page on another site. Layaview serves programs on this machine, not pages elsewhere.

Laya's answers and refusals are recorded, and so are 502s. The 400s, 413s and 403s are not.

## Read what was recorded (JSON, from this machine only)

- GET ${origin}/_/api/records?since=<n>: summaries in the order calls finished, at most ${PAGE.toLocaleString("en")} at a time.
- GET ${origin}/_/api/records?ids=<id>,<id>: summaries of named calls, at most ${IDS_LISTED.toLocaleString("en")}.
- GET ${origin}/_/api/records/<id>: one call, the request sent to Laya and the response it returned.
- GET ${origin}/_/api/search?q=<words>: ids of calls whose label, trigger, request or response contains every word.

A record's "key" is the sha256 of the exact body sent to Laya.
