// Support Desk: a made-up support inbox that Laya triages through Layaview, drawn live in the browser.

//
// Open http://127.0.0.1:4782/ to watch. Made-up customers write in, one every --pace milliseconds or so. Laya reads each
// message once (what it is about, how urgent, is the customer upset, could a help article answer it), and some answers
// lead on to more questions, each sent with a Layaview-Trigger header naming the answer that led to it: the topic decides
// which team takes it, a topic Laya was unsure of is read again with the customer's account beside it, an upset customer
// may be offered a credit, a message an article could answer gets the article, and one about nothing we do is checked
// for spam. Now and then Laya is also asked whether the customer may leave or what language the message is in, and
// --fail says how often a message also sends a call Laya rejects. Open Layaview beside it to watch Laya think. It runs only while a page is open,
// and every call goes to the configured local Laya adapter through Layaview.
